# Generator Results Figures

This folder contains SDF files and a visualization script for comparing 3D structures of the target molecule OFOWIS generated by different 3D structure generators.

The original reference structure (`OFOWIS.sdf`) can be downloaded from the [Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC)](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/).

- `OFOWIS_ccdc.sdf`, `OFOWIS_obabel.sdf`, `OFOWIS_rdkit.sdf` contain the 3D structures of OFOWIS generated by the CCDC, Open Babel, and RDKit generators, respectively.

## Usage

To visualize and highlight specific Ir–X bonds (excluding Ir–Cl and the relevant Ir–C bond), edit the `SDF_FILE` variable at the top of `generate_pymols_for_figure.py` to match one of the provided filenames. Then, run the script with PyMOL:

```bash
pymol generate_pymols_for_figure.py
```

The images generated were used in Figure 6 of the main paper (TODO: add reference).
